## 2. Quick Start Guide: How to handle an AI Booking
> "Our AI has just booked a job for you! Here is what happens next:"
1.  **Notification:** You will receive a Slack/Email/SMS alert with the job details.
2.  **CRM:** A new job entry will appear in your 'Unassigned' or 'Pending' queue labeled **[AI BOOKED]**.
3.  **Action:** Your dispatcher just needs to assign the technician. The customer has already been qualified and the address is verified.
4.  **No Action Needed:** The customer has received a confirmation text and a calendar invite.

## 3. How to Use the AI Revenue Dashboard
*   **Total Revenue:** This is the big number. It shows the total invoice value of jobs originated by the AI.
*   **Live Transcripts:** Accessible 24/7. Use these to listen to how your customers are interacting with the brand.
*   **Missed Call Log:** View every call the AI recovered. These are the jobs your competitors didn't get.

## 4. AI Usage & Compliance Policy
*   **Transparency:** The AI is programmed to identify as an "AI Assistant" if asked directly, ensuring trust.
*   **TCPA Compliance:** All SMS messages include "Reply STOP to opt out." We only text customers who have initiated a call to your business (Inbound context).
*   **Data Security:** All recordings and transcripts are encrypted at rest and in transit.

## 5. SOP Documentation Structure
We provide the client with a shared Notion or Drive folder containing:
*   **SOP-001:** Emergency Escalation Procedures.
*   **SOP-002:** Updating the AI Knowledge Base (e.g., adding a new service).
*   **SOP-003:** Interpreting the Weekly Revenue Report.
*   **SOP-004:** Troubleshooting CRM sync issues.

## 6. Feedback Loop
If you notice the AI is providing incorrect info (e.g., "We don't do Boiler repair" when you actually do), simply email `updates@youragency.com`. We update the LLM context within 4 business hours.
