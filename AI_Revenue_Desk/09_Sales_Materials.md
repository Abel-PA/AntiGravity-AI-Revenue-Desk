# AI Revenue Desk™ — Sales Materials

## 1. The 60-Second Elevator Pitch
"Every day, your business is leaking thousands of dollars because your team can't get to the phone fast enough. In the home service world, the first person to answer wins the job. We built the AI Revenue Desk to ensure you never miss a call again. It's a 24/7 AI receptionist that qualifies, books, and even texts back missed callers in seconds. It doesn't just answer phones; it manages your entire revenue pipeline and shows you exactly how much money it's making you every single week. It costs less than a part-timer and works 10x harder."

## 2. Discovery Call Framework (5 Minutes)
*   **The Hook:** "I noticed you have a 4.5-star rating on Google. You must be busy. How many calls do you think your team misses on a Monday morning or after 6 PM?"
*   **The Pain:** "When someone misses a call from you, they don't leave a voicemail. They call the next person on the list. How much is an average job worth to you? $1,000? $5,000?"
*   **The Gap:** "Right now, your only options are expensive call centers that sound like robots or letting it go to voicemail. What if you had an AI that sounded just like your best employee and booked the job right then and there?"
*   **The Close:** "I'd like to run a 'Revenue Leak Audit' for you where we track your missed calls for 48 hours and show you exactly what's being left on the table. Does Wednesday at 10 AM work to review that?"

## 3. Objection Handling Scripts

| Objection | Response |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"I have a call center."** | "Call centers are great, but they often have 30-second hold times and high turnover. Our AI answers in 1 second, has 100% product knowledge, and costs 60% less. Plus, it links directly to your revenue dashboard." |
| **"It’s too new/I don’t trust AI."** | "I completely understand. That's why we start with a 'Shadow Mode' where the AI only handles overflow. You can read every transcript. If it's not better than a human, we don't move to full roll-out." |
| **"Our jobs are too complex to book."** | "The AI doesn't need to be a technician; it just needs to be a great receptionist. It identifies the issue, grabs the address, and gets them in the calendar. Your experts handle the rest." |

## 4. Closing Framework: The ROI Pivot
"If this system books just **two** extra AC installs or four smaller repairs a month, it has paid for itself. Everything after that is pure profit. We can have your custom AI live and recovering jobs in 14 days. Should we start with the Core or the Revenue Engine tier?"

## 5. Demo Outline
1.  **The Live Call:** Have the client call a demo number. The AI answers, recognizes their name (from caller ID), and proceeds to "qualify" them for a fake leak.
2.  **The SMS Bounce:** Hang up mid-call. Show the client the "Missed Call Recovery" text hitting their phone 5 seconds later.
3.  **The Dashboard:** Show a sample Revenue Attribution dashboard with real-time ROI stats.
4.  **The Integration:** Show how the demo call just created a mock ticket in the CRM.
