## ROI Framing & Justification
> "A typical HVAC company with $3M in annual revenue misses roughly 15-20% of calls. If we recover just 5 jobs per month at an average ticket of $2,500, that is **$12,500 in new revenue.**"
*   **Monthly Cost:** $4,000
*   **Net Profit Contribution:** $8,500
*   **Annual Impact:** $102,000+ in found money.
*   **Comparison:** Hiring two full-time 24/7 human receptionists would cost $8,000 - $10,000/month with zero consistency.

## Upsell Paths
*   **React-AI:** AI outbound campaigns to "Dead Leads" in the CRM ($2,500 setup).
*   **AI Service Coordinator:** AI that calls technicians to confirm arrival times (Custom quote).
*   **Multi-Lingual Add-on:** Full Spanish/French voice capabilities (+$1,000/mo).

## Long-term Retention Strategy
*   **Performance Bonuses:** By tying a portion of our pay to successful bookings ($50/job), we become a partner in the client's growth, not just a vendor.
*   **Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs):** Present a "Year in Revenue" report showing the total $ magnitude of the AI's impact.
